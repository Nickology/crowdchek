	<h1>Brexit begins: UK triggers Article 50 to begin EU divorce</h1>

	<p>London (CNN)The UK government has formally served divorce papers on the European Union, signaling the beginning of the end of a relationship that has endured for 44 years.</p>

	<p>Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, confirmed that the UK had triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, beginning a legal process that must end in two years' time with Britain leaving the EU.</p>

	<p>"This is an historic moment for which there can be no turning back. Britain is leaving the European Union," May told the House of Commons in London.</p>

	<p>A few minutes earlier in Brussels, the British Permanent Representative to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, delivered a six-page formal letter of notification to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, in Brussels.</p>

	<p>"The Article 50 process is now under way, and in accordance with the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union," May said.</p>
